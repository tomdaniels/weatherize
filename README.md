# weatherize

Simple command line app to retrieve weather information from an area relevant to you.

- You can search anything from a single post code, to an exact address.
> If you receive information from an unexpected location, you may need to be more specific with the search term.

## Installing the application
- Run the below commands:
```bash
    git clone git@github.com:tomdaniels/weatherize.git && cd weatherize
    yarn install
```

## How to use it?

```bash
node index.js -a {location/address}
```

- Both app.js & index.js will have the same result. The difference is in the code, not the output ;)
